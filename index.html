        <!-- Mercury -->
        <h2>Mercury is hot, but not too hot for ice</h2>
        <p> 
            The closest planet to the Sun does indeed have ice on its surface. 
            That sounds surprising at first glance, but the ice is found in permanently shadowed craters — 
            those that never receive any sunlight. It is thought that perhaps comets 
            delivered this ice to Mercury in the first place. In fact, NASA’s MESSENGER spacecraft 
            not only found ice at the north pole, but it also found organics, 
            which are the building blocks for life. Mercury is way too hot and airless for life as we know it, 
            but it shows how these elements are distributed across the Solar System.

        <!-- venus -->

        <h2>Venus might have potential for life</h2>
        <p> 
            Thirty miles up (about 50 kilometers) from the surface of Venus temperatures range from 86 to 158 
            Fahrenheit (30 to 70 Celsius). This temperature range could accommodate Earthly life, 
            such as “extremophile” microbes. And atmospheric pressure at that height is similar to what we 
            find on Earth’s surface.

        <!-- Earth -->
        
        <h2>Earth isn't actually round</h2>
        <p>
            While the Earth appears to be round when viewed from the vantage point of space, it is actually 
            closer to an ellipsoid. However, even an ellipsoid does not adequately describe the Earth's 
            unique and ever-changing shape.

        <!-- Mars -->
        <h2>One day on Mars takes a little over 24 hours</h2>
        <p> 
            Mars makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Martian time) in 687 Earth days. Mars is a rocky planet.
            Its solid surface has been altered by volcanoes, impacts, winds, crustal movement and chemical reactions.

        <!-- Jupiter -->
        <h2>Jupiter rotates once about every 10 hours which is called a Jovian day</h2>
        <p>
            Jupiter's stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in 
            an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than 
            Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.

        <!-- Saturn -->
        <h2>You can not stand on Saturn</h2>
        <p>
            You couldn't stand on Saturn, because there's no solid surface to stand on. If you tried to “land” on Saturn, 
            you'd sink thousands of miles to depths where the heat and pressure are so high that not even the sturdiest 
            submarine could survive!

        <!-- Uranus -->
        <h2>A year on Uranus is equal to 84 Earth years.</h2>
        <p>
            Uranus has a unique tilt that makes it appear to spin sideways. Uranus is four times wider than Earth.  Uranus is one of two ice giants in the outer solar system. </p>

        <!-- Neptune -->
        <h2>A year on Neptune is about 165 Earth years</h2>
        <p>Neptune is about four times wider than Earth. Its radius is about 15,299 miles, or about 24,622 kilometers. Neptune has 14 moons.  </p>

        <!-- Pluto -->
        <h2><It's about 3.6 billion miles away from the Sun, and it has a thin atmosphere composed mostly of nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide></h2>
        <p>
            On average, Pluto's temperature is -387°F (-232°C), making it too cold to sustain life. Pluto is orbited by five known moons, the largest of which is Charon.
